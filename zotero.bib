The proof uses the flag algebra framework together with some additional stability arguments. This problem is equivalent to some specific type of edge colourings of complete graphs with two colours, where the number of monochromatic K4 is minimized. We show that all the extremal colourings must contain monochromatic K4 only in one of the two colours. This translates back to permutations, where all the monotone subsequences of length four are all either increasing, or decreasing only.},

Reed's conjecture states that \$\textbackslash chi \textbackslash leq \textbackslash lceil (1-\textbackslash varepsilon)(\textbackslash Delta + 1) + \textbackslash varepsilon\textbackslash omega \textbackslash rceil\$ for all \$\textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash leq 1/2\$. It was shown by King and Reed that, provided \$\textbackslash Delta\$ is large enough, the conjecture holds for \$\textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash leq 1/130,000\$. In this article, we show that the same statement holds for \$\textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash leq 1/26\$, thus making a significant step towards Reed's conjecture. We derive this result from a general technique to bound the chromatic number of a graph where no vertex has many edges in its neighbourhood. Our improvements to this method also lead to improved bounds on the strong chromatic index of general graphs. We prove that \$\textbackslash chi'\_s(G)\textbackslash leq 1.835 \textbackslash Delta(G)\textasciicircum 2\$ provided \$\textbackslash Delta(G)\$ is large enough.},

We discuss the algorithm used, its computational complexity, and storage requirements. Finally, we present benchmark results for a collection of test problems.},

Next we establish results on the analytic representation of limits of order types by planar measures. Our main result is a rigidity theorem: we show that if sampling two measures induce the same probability distribution on order types, then these measures are projectively equivalent provided the support of at least one of them has non-empty interior. We also show that some condition on the Hausdorff dimension of the support is necessary to obtain projective rigidity and we construct limits of order types that cannot be represented by a planar measure. Returning to combinatorial geometry we relate the regularity of this analytic representation to the aforementioned problem of Erd\textbackslash H\{o\}s on the density of k-tuples in convex position, for large k.},

Which asymptotic relations exist between the quantities p(M₁, N),...,p(Mh, N), where M₁,...,Mh are fixed "template" models and |N| grows to infinity? In this paper we develop a formal calculus that captures many standard arguments in the area, both previously known and apparently new.

  abstract = {For the most part, this article is a survey of concrete results in extremal combinatorics obtained with the method of flag algebras. But our survey is also preceded, interleaved and concluded with a few general digressions about the method itself. Also, instead of giving a plain and unannotated list of results, we try to divide our account into several connected stories that often include historical background, motivations and results obtained with the help of methods other than flag algebras.},

  abstract = {The theory of flag algebras, introduced by Razborov in 2007, has opened the way to a systematic approach to the development of computer-assisted proofs in extremal combinatorics. It makes it possible to derive bounds for parameters in extremal combinatorics with the help of a computer, in a semi-automated manner. This article describes the main points of the theory in a complete way, using Mantel's theorem as a guiding example.},
