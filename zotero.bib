  abstract = {Let \$G\$ be a graph with chromatic number \$\textbackslash chi\$, maximum degree \$\textbackslash Delta\$ and clique number \$\textbackslash omega\$. Reed's conjecture states that \$\textbackslash chi \textbackslash leq \textbackslash lceil (1-\textbackslash varepsilon)(\textbackslash Delta + 1) + \textbackslash varepsilon\textbackslash omega \textbackslash rceil\$ for all \$\textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash leq 1/2\$. It was shown by King and Reed that, provided \$\textbackslash Delta\$ is large enough, the conjecture holds for \$\textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash leq 1/130,000\$. In this article, we show that the same statement holds for \$\textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash leq 1/26\$, thus making a significant step towards Reed's conjecture. We derive this result from a general technique to bound the chromatic number of a graph where no vertex has many edges in its neighbourhood. Our improvements to this method also lead to improved bounds on the strong chromatic index of general graphs. We prove that \$\textbackslash chi'\_s(G)\textbackslash leq 1.835 \textbackslash Delta(G)\textasciicircum 2\$ provided \$\textbackslash Delta(G)\$ is large enough.},

The main advantages of this code are that it can be used as a stand alone solver or as a callable subroutine, that it is written in C for efficiency, that it makes effective use of sparsity in the constraint matrices, and that it includes support for linear inequality constraints in addition to linear equality constraints. We discuss the algorithm used, its computational complexity, and storage requirements. Finally, we present benchmark results for a collection of test problems.},

As two consequences, we advance the state of the art in two longstanding and well-studied graph colouring conjectures, the Erdős-Nešetřil conjecture and Reed's conjecture. We prove that the strong chromatic index is at most \$1.772Δ\textasciicircum 2\$ for any graph \$G\$ with sufficiently large maximum degree \$Δ\$. We prove that the chromatic number is at most \$\textbackslash lceil 0.881(Δ+1)+0.119ω\textbackslash rceil\$ for any graph \$G\$ with clique number \$ω\$ and sufficiently large maximum degree \$Δ\$. Additionally, we show how our methods can be adapted under the additional assumption that the codegree is at most \$(1-σ)Δ\$, and establish what may be considered first progress towards a conjecture of Vu.},

Towards the end we will introduce the semidefinite method as well as point out a few instances of flag algebra being used in recent research in extremal graph theory.

For finite models M, N of an universal theory without constants and function symbols (like graphs, digraphs or hypergraphs), let p(M, N) be the probability that a randomly chosen sub-model of N with |M| elements is isomorphic to M. Which asymptotic relations exist between the quantities p(M₁, N),...,p(Mh, N), where M₁,...,Mh are fixed "template" models and |N| grows to infinity? In this paper we develop a formal calculus that captures many standard arguments in the area, both previously known and apparently new. We give the first application of this formalism by presenting a new simple proof of a result by Fisher about the minimal possible density of triangles in a graph with given edge density.},
