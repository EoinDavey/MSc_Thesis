\begin{abstract}
    In this thesis we introduce a novel framework inspired by Razborov's flag algebras
    which we are calling \textit{local flags}. This new framework enables us to use
    the semidefinite method to prove new bounds on a wide family of "local" combinatorial
    functions. We use this new framework to
    make progress on a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Nešetřil, finding a
    best-yet asymptotic upper bound on the strong chromatic index of a graph.
    We also apply this new framework to make the first progress on the bipartite special case of
    this conjecture.
    Additionally, we explore a bounded degree version of Erd\H{o}s' pentagon
    conjecture: We state a conjecture and make significant progress toward proving it using
    the new framework. This thesis serves as both an introduction and a handbook on applying
    this method as we believe it has the potential to be used for many other applications.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Popular summary}
A graph is a set of points (vertices) and lines (edges).
e.g. \includegraphics[align=c,scale=1]{flags/k4} or
\includegraphics[align=c,scale=0.75]{pop_sum_graph}.

The study of graphs (Graph Theory) has been a central pillar of mathematics since Euler studied the
bridges of Königsberg in 1736. One of the first things we can study is the fact
that graphs can contain other graphs: Take some subset of the vertices
and look at only those vertices and the edges between them and you end up with another graph.
One can then ask, "How many copies of a graph $F$ are there in a graph $G$"?
A famous Dutch result is \textit{Mantel's theorem} which says a graph of size $n$
with no triangles ($\triangleflag$) has $\leq \frac{n^2}{4}$ edges.

We can then ask, "What is the \textit{density} of a graph $F$ in another graph $G$"? i.e. How
many copies of $F$ are there in $G$, divided by by the max possible number of copies of $F$.
We call this $p(F; G)$.
Consider a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges:
There are at most $\binom{n}{2}$ edges in a graph of size $n$, so we say the \textit{edge
density} is $p(\edge; G) = m/\binom{n}{2}$.
We can re-write Mantel's
theorem to say the density of edges in a triangle free graph is at most
$m/\binom{n}{2} \leq \frac{n^2}{4}/\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{1}{2}$.
It turns out these densities have some
nice properties. For example, in any graph the density of edges (\edge) and non-edges
(\nonedge) always add up to 1. This is as the number of pairs of vertices which don't have
an edge is $\binom{n}{2} - m$ hence:
\[p(\edge; G) + p(\nonedge; G) = \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}+\frac{\binom{n}{2}-m}{\binom{n}{2}} = 1\]

In general, the sum of the densities of all graphs of some fixed size
is always 1! If we wanted to come up with some nice notation to work with we might like to write
this as $\edge + \nonedge = 1$,
$\triangleflag + \triangletwoedge + \triangleoneedge + \triangleempty = 1$, etc.
It turns out then that we can rigorously create this notation (formally an algebra)
out of graphs where statements like
$\edge + \nonedge = 1$ are true. Then, any statement we prove with this notation turns out
to be a true statement about densities of graphs. These algebras are called \textit{flag algebras}.
These algebras are very easily manipulated by computers so we can use them in combination
with computer search to prove new results about densities.

In this thesis we create a new type of algebra very similar to flag algebras which we
use to make progress on some classic graph theory problems, as well as some new problems.

One classic problem we made progress on is the \textit{strong edge colouring conjecture}:
Given a graph we can assign a colour to each edge. A \textit{proper} colouring is one where
no edges which touch (share a vertex) have the same
colour. A \textit{strong} colouring then also requires edges which touch a common edge
have different colours. We can then ask "What is the minimum colours needed for a
strong edge colouring"?
Erd\H{o}s and Nešetřil conjectured in 1985 that you only need $1.25\Delta(G)^2$ colours
where $\Delta(G)$ is the max degree (the max number of edges at any vertex). We prove,
using our local flags, that you need at most $1.73\Delta(G)^2$ colours,
which is the best known bound.
